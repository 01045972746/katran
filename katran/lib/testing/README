to be able to test katran, you must:
0) have linux kernel's src in ~/linux directory
1) run ~/fbcode/ti/katran/build_katran_tester.sh

  to run unittests:
    "run ~/fbcode/ti/katran/run_katran_tester.sh" script
  example of output: P58146813

  to run perf tests:
    you need to uncomment "// prototype for DDoS scrubbing feature." section
    in ~/fbcode/ti/katran/bpf/balancer_kern.c then rebuild bpf program
    with cd ~/fbcode/ti/katran && ./build_bpf_modules.sh
    and run
    "~/fbcode/ti/katran/run_katran_tester.sh perf" script
  example of output: P58146836
